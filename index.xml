The backtracking algorithm traverses this search tree recursively , from the root down, in depth-first order . At each node c, the algorithm checks whether c can be completed to a valid solution. If it cannot, the whole sub-tree rooted at c is skipped (pruned).</description></item><item><title>Timer Callback</title><link>https://seyoungjeong.github.io/posts/timer_callback/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://seyoungjeong.github.io/posts/timer_callback/</guid><description>This is an interview question for embedded software engineer.
ISR gets called with a certain unsigned integer value every 1ms.
Write the ISR callback to return average of values during 1 sec
The timer callback gets invoked from ISR.
First of all we need to calculate the average as fast as possible because this is called in ISR context. Instead of calculating sum of 1000 values during past 1 sec every time, we can cache the previous sum to calculate the average.</description></item><item><title>PCIe Configuration space in Windows driver’s point of view</title><link>https://seyoungjeong.github.io/posts/pcie-configuration-space-in-windows-drivers-point-of-view/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://seyoungjeong.github.io/posts/pcie-configuration-space-in-windows-drivers-point-of-view/</guid><description>What is PCIe? PCI Express, technically Peripheral Component Interconnect Express is a standard type of connection for internal devices in a computer.

I got asked this questions already two times during screening interview with FANNG and failed two times. The ring buffer structure is also known as a circular queue. The different names come from two different usages. In embedded systems, in order to receive and send data to a peripheral device such as UART, a ring buffer is common to cache the data.</description></item></channel></rss>
