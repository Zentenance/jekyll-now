      <description>Overview  Implement a ring buffer in C.
 I got asked this questions already two times during screening interview with FANNG and failed two times. The ring buffer structure is also known as a circular queue. The different names come from two different usages. In embedded systems, in order to receive and send data to a peripheral device such as UART, a ring buffer is common to cache the data.</description>

      <description>Timer Callback  ISR gets called with a certain unsigned integer value every 1ms.
Write ISR callback to return average of values during 1 sec
 Yeah ISR doesn’t take a parameter in real world. This is an interview question for embedded software engineer.
First of all we need to calculate the average as fast as possible because this is in ISR. Instead of calculating sum of 1000 values during past 1 sec every time, we can cache the previous sum to calculate the average.</description>
